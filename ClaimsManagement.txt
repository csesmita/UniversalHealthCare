Claims Management
-------------------

Claims Management flow is responsible for ensuring claims originating in the system are adjudicated at the earliest. In order to do so, this flow takes into account inputs from an external Fraud Management System (FMS) which strongly accepts, strongly rejects, or advices TPA intervention for a newly filed and documented claim. Every claim that is adjudicated by the system is fed into the FMS as a data point.

The interaction between various modules also ensures that any claim adjudicated in the past, may be re-assessed on input from FMS. This is to ensure that with better data, all fraudulent dealings that occurred in the past may also be analysed and corresponding erring entities be penalized. When acting on such recommendations, detailed analyses is provided to the FMS as feedback, along with the case resolution.

Therefore, to summarize, this document enumerates the relation between various modules in the Claims process, in order to -
1. Ensure faster claims adjudication by assisting IC/TPA in decision making (Adjudication Recommender)
2. Provide data points for Fraud Management Systems(FMS) to capture trends, patterns and anomalies. 
3. Be able to consume fraud indicators on past claims from FMS, re-assess them, and feed analyses back to FMS


High Level Claims Flow Interaction
----------------------------------
----------------------------------

UHC's New Claims Management
----------------------------

1. New claim processing requested from UHC's Adjudication Recommender System (ARS).

2. ARS requests Policy/Entity Status Details from Policy DB and Claims DB respectively.

3. Policy DB returns details of Policy. Similarly Claims DB returns any internal state flagging the entities, like blacklisting, etc.

If claim is found to not conform to policy, or documentation is non-conformant, or the entity is blacklisted, it strongly recommendas a rejection of the claim along with the appropriate Reject Code and reason text, and exits. Else, it proceeds.

4. ARS requests a secure SHA-x hash of the entities involved in the claim - doctor, beneficiary and the hospital.

5. Claim Recommendation Requested API - ARS requests a claims recommendation from the Fraud Management System (FMS) based on the hash'ed identifiers of entities involved in the claim (#5), and the claim details itself (claim ID, procedure, amount, number of days the treatment lasted, etc).

6. FMS reverts with a strongly accept, strongly reject, or TPA intervention recommendation based on the information provided in #6. More than one FMS might be requested for this information.

(Various FMS might arrive at this claims' recommendation using historic trends for procedure as well as historic trends on beneficiary, doctor and provider.)

7. ARS may also request for current recommendation on entities and store them for logging purposes (High Tendency towards Fraud, Low Tendency Towards Fraud, Neutral).

8. All information received for the claim from FMS is updated for the claim in the ClaimsDB, including any logging information (entity recommendations may be stored in respective entity databases).

9. ARS recommends acceptance, rejection, or TPA intervention (as received), with any additional claims related information/logs.

10. TPA Action - TPA is required to sign off while adjudicating claims. When doing so, TPA's final action is received by the ARS

11. TPA Action is recorded in the Claims DB.

12. Claim Adjudicated API - TPA's action is sent to FMS along with information on TPA action, claim ID, and any reason text.

UHC's Adjudicated Claims' Audit Management
------------------------------------

There will also be provision for older, already adjudicated claims to be audited by FMS. The flow will be as follows -

1. FMS recommends Claim Audit to ARS - Claim Id, TPA action, hash of entities involved, and audit reason

2. ARS updates Clams DB with audit recommendation request for the provided Claim ID.

3. ARS passes on the Claims Audit recommendation to the TPA

4. TPA updates cases with analyses and provides it to the ARS

5. TPA analyses is updated in the Claims DB.

6. Update to Claims DB also triggers an update notification to the FMS, citing case analyses.

TPA concludes the audit by updating both the Claims DB and FMS with audit anlyses and closure status, along with reason text.

Practical example from a Fraud Management System Provider
-----------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------

Examples of Commonly Occurring Fraud
---------------------------------------
Some examples of data analysed by Fraud Management System are (courtesy Trendwise Analytics) -

1. Doctors, who treated whopping, say 50+ patients in a day. 
2. Providers administering far higher rates of tests than others. 
3. Providers costing far more, per patient basis, than others. 
4. Providers with high ratio of distance patients. 
5. Providers prescribing certain drugs at higher rate than others. 
6. Distance between claimantâ€™s home address and medical provider 
7. Multiple medical opinions/providers 
8. Changing providers for the same treatment (possibly correlated with other claim activity) 
9. High number of treatments for type of injury 
10. Abnormally long treatment time off for the type of injury 
11. Accident severity does not correlate with severity of injury 
12. Providers billing for services not provided. 
13. Providers administering (more) tests and treatments or providing equipments that are not medically necessary. 
14. Providers administering more expensive tests and equipments (up-coding). 
15. Providers multiple-billing for services rendered. 
16. Providers unbundling or billing separately for laboratory tests performed together to get higher reimbursements. 
17. Providers charging more than peers for the same services. 
18. Providers conducting medically unrelated procedures and services. 
19. Policy holders traveling long distance for treatment which may be available nearby. (Possibly scams by bogus providers.) 
20. Policy holders letting others use their healthcare cards. 

Therefore, a long term database is desirable to aggregate past trends and present to the Claims engine as required. 

Claims Trust Score Management Engine
--------------------------------------
A trust score is the probability that a given claim is not a fraud. 
A mathematical predictor model will be used in order to arrive at a trust score for any claim that is under processing. 
Trust score for a claim is computed on both the entities as well as past anonymised trends -

Entities (Health Care Provider and Beneficiary) Related Historic Trends -
1. Percentage of claims filed by the entities (health care provider, Doctor, or the beneficiary) Accepted with high confidence (Adjudication engine score is >80%)
2. Percentage of claims filed by the entities (health care provider, Doctor, or the beneficiary) Not Accepted with high confidence (<30% score by Adjucation engine)
3. Percentage of claims filed by the entities (health care provider, Doctor, or the beneficiary) audited and found fradulent (in retrospect or during claims filing process)
4. Average billed amount / Billed amount for this procedure
5. Number of patients treated (if health care provider) on this day/week/month
6. Reporting Lags
7. Treatment Characteristics and Procedures
8. Years of Experience of Doctor
9. Number of Prior Incidents from Doctor 
10. Number of Unauthorized claims from the entities

General Historic Trends (coming from Fraud Management Engine, aggregating stats similar to the examples quoted on fraud) -
1. Average number of claims filed and accepted with high confidence
2. Average number of claims filed and not accepted with high confidence
3. Average number of claims audited and found fraudulent
4. Average Billed amount for this procedure
5. Average number of patients treated per day/week/month
6. Average Reporting Lags
7. Average Treatment Characteristics and Procedures
8. Average Years of Experience of Doctor
9. Average Number of Prior Incidents from Doctor 
10. Average Number of Unauthorized claims from the entities
11. Average number of cases filed by the doctor in one day
12. ...


Adjudication Recommender System (ARS)
--------------------------------------
The Adjudication engine acts as a recommender system for Insurers. It will assist the ICs and TPAs to make faster and more data-driven decisions when a new claim is presented.

The adjudication engine will do the following -
1. Parse the Policy DB and apply it on the claim presented. 
   If not found in order, the claim is strongly recommended to be rejected.

2. Based on the Claims Trust Score Engine, the Adjudication Engine will either -
   a. Strongly recommend Accepting the claim (>80% confidence) citing relevant parameters from Claim Trust Score Engine
   b. Strongly recommend Rejecting the claim (<30% confidence) citing relevant parameters from Claim Trust Score Engine
   c. Recommend TPA/IC intervention (30-80% confidence levels)

A TPA sign off is still required in order to set the status of the claims to accepted or rejected. The claims trust score engine is expected to learn from TPA action on the claim for future.


Fraud Management System (FMS)
-------------------------
Fraud Management System is a generic system which will collect anonymised claims data in order to identify current trends and be able to suggest to the Trust Score Engine with higher accuracy.

This analysis may be applied across Claims, Entities, Procedures, and at geographical units like District, City, State, Country, etc.

This module will also enable data analytics to be run on top of the UHC system in order for various government agencies, insurers and hospitals to monitor the general health of the public.


Incentive to Report Fraud -
-----------------------------
In order to assist fraud detection, it is suggested that beneficiaries be given incentives to report fraudulent claims filing. This necessrily means the identity of the reporter should be confidential. This will boost the Fraud management system, and also bring in resistance toengaging in unlawful practises.


Score Management - Claim Score (with Entity Score computed at runtime)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
There is an implicit entity score (provider score and beneficiary score). These are computed at run time to aid computing the claim score. Why are these runtime? A lot of these parameters are based on current trends as well (number of patients treated on this day/week/month, reporting Lags,Treatment Characteristics and Procedures, etc and for beneficiary it might be the number of times claims have been filed in the past week/month/year). Therefore, these scores are moving, and not static. Hence, they will be computed at runtime to arrive at a score for the claim.



                                                  
                                                 
                                       
                                        
Feedback Loop Augmenting Fraud Detection and Learning
------------------------------------------------------

Every claim feeds back into the fraud management system in order to build a continuous stream of information.
This ensures -
1. Historic trends evolve with time
2. Every data point is captured, and any anomolies can be captured and past claims may be reviewed.
3. More complex pattern extraction and fraud analysis can be done.
